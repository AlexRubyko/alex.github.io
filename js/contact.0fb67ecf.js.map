Lets say we have a class motor vehicle and than we diside we want a specialization of that a car or automobile class, or than later on we might want a truck class which is again a specialization of motor vehicle. Being able to use inheritance allows us to reuse code quate a bit because a specialization of a original class, called a base class can use the code from the base class over and over again.
