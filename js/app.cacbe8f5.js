The company has a multinational team motivated to deliver superior power electronics module products to meet our customer requirements and accelerate SiC adoption.","main-business-heading":"Semiland's Main Business","main-business-explanation":'Semiland\'s core business focuses on research, development, manufacturing, and selling of high-density power electronic modules, especially the third generation of Wide Bandgap semiconductor power module products. Wide bandgap semiconductors operate at temperatures over 300 degrees, handle 10 times higher voltages and eliminate up to 90 percent of power losses in electricity transfer compared to current technology. To take full advantage of these excellent devices properties, our team is targeting high temperatures, low parasitic inductance, high voltage breakdown, and high switching frequency module products for the application areas including PV, wind power, EV/HEV, train, smart grid and so on. We are also working on the WBG products to fit into the "New Infrastructure" plan proposed by the Chinese central government, which refers to the 5G, AI, Industrial internet, IoT.',"application-area":"APPLICATION AREA","home-renev":"Renewables","home-renev-explanation":"A high-value application area is needed to settle a new device technology in the beginning stage of the high cost SiC transistors. Beside military and harsh-environmental applications, renewable energy systems are the most promising industrial application with high growth rates. The application of SiC power semiconductor devices in a PV energy system can help eliminate several issues which are at present due to the material limitations of silicon, and the need for a highly efficient and reliable power conversion system in wind turbines were also matched with the material properties of SiC.The unipolar nature of SiC MOSFET favors the development of high switching frequency power converters thereby reducing the size, weight and cost of system while maintaining superio performance as compared to its silicon IGBT counterpart.","home-Ev-Hev":"EV/HEV","home-Ev-Hev-explanation":"The components involved in power semiconductor applications in EV system architecture include: motor driver, on board charger (OBC), on-board DC/ DC and off-board charging pile.

La société dispose d'une équipe multinationale motivée à fournir des produits de modules électroniques de puissance supérieurs pour répondre aux exigences de nos clients et accélérer l'adoption des carbures de silicium.","main-business-heading":"*** Semiland's Main Business","main-business-explanation":'*** Semiland\'s core business focuses on research, development, manufacturing, and selling of high-density power electronic modules, especially the third generation of Wide Bandgap semiconductor power module products. Wide bandgap semiconductors operate at temperatures over 300 degrees, handle 10 times higher voltages and eliminate up to 90 percent of power losses in electricity transfer compared to current technology. To take full advantage of these excellent devices properties, our team is targeting high temperatures, low parasitic inductance, high voltage breakdown, and high switching frequency module products for the application areas including PV, wind power, EV/HEV, train, smart grid and so on. We are also working on the WBG products to fit into the "New Infrastructure" plan proposed by the Chinese central government, which refers to the 5G, AI, Industrial internet, IoT.',"application-area":"*** APPLICATION AREA","home-renev":"Energies renouvelables","home-renev-explanation":"Un domaine d'application de grande valeur qui est nécessaire pour mettre en place une nouvelle technologie de dispositif de transistors SiC qui à son stade initial à un coût élevé. Outre les applications militaires et environnementales difficiles, les systèmes d'énergie renouvelable ont l’application industrielle la plus prometteuse avec des taux de croissance élevés. L'application de dispositifs semi-conducteurs d’alimentation en carbure de silicium dans un système d'énergie photovoltaïque peut aider à éliminer plusieurs problèmes qui sont actuellement dus aux limitations matérielles du silicium, et la nécessité d'un système de conversion de puissance très efficace et fiable dans les éoliennes a également été adaptée aux propriétés matérielles du carbure de silicium. La nature unipolaire du SiC MOSFET favorise le développement des convertisseurs d’alimentation à haute fréquence de commutation, réduisant ainsi la taille, le poids et le coût du système tout en maintenant des performances supérieures à celles de son homologue IGBT au silicium.","home-Ev-Hev":"Véhicule électrique (VE) / Véhicule électrique hybride(VEH)","home-Ev-Hev-explanation":"Les composants impliqués dans les applications de semi-conducteurs d’alimentation dans l'architecture de système EV comprennent : le pilote de moteur, le chargeur embarqué (OBC), le DC / DC embarqué et la pile de charge externe.

Dans le même temps, la tendance à l'intégration du moteur et du contrôleur nécessite une vitesse plus élevée des moteurs, une fréquence de travail plus élevée et une taille plus petite des contrôleurs.
